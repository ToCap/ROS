# ![Touch Sensor](docs/touch_sensor.png) Touch Sensor Interface

The Touch Sensor detects whether the button on the face of the sensor is pressed in. You can use a Touch Sensor to detect, for example, when your robot drives into something. You could also use a finger press on a Touch Sensor to trigger an action.

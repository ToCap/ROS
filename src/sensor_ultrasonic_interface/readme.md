# ![Touch Sensor](docs/ultrasonic_sensor.png) Ultrasonic Sensor Interface

The Ultrasonic Sensor can measure the distance to an object in front of it. It does this by sending out sound waves and measuring how long it takes the sound to reflect back to the sensor. The sound frequency is too high for you to hear (“ultrasonic”).

You can measure the distance to an object in either inches or centimeters. You could use this to, for example, make your robot stop a certain distance from a wall.
